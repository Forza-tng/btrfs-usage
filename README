btrfs space usage tool
======================

This is a small web-app to estimate the amount of space that you'll
get out of btrfs in different disk and RAID configurations.

Build and deployment
====================

This project is written entirely in elm, so you will need to install
the elm compiler (https://elm-lang.org/).

To build, simply:

 $ make

Unit tests are provided with elm-test:

 $ elm-test

Deployment is then a matter of copying the contents of the
./build/assets directory into a web server.
